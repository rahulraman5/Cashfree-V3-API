Cashfree Payment Integration
This repository contains a sample PHP script for integrating Cashfree's payment gateway using the Cashfree JavaScript SDK. 
The integration facilitates the creation of orders and redirects users to the Cashfree checkout page for payment processing.

Usage
1. Modify the PHP script to include your specific product details and other required parameters.
2. Ensure that you have the correct Cashfree API credentials (x-client-id and x-client-secret) in the cURL headers.
3. Run the PHP script to initiate the order creation and redirection to the Cashfree checkout page.
   
Note: This example uses the Cashfree sandbox environment. Update URLs and credentials for the production environment when integrating into a live system.
